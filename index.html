									<h2>MODEL UNITED NATIONS</h2>
									<p>Being a first timer in a Model United Nations conference, the rules of procedure are seemingly complicated, and honestly there is a lot to remember.</p>
									<p>Let’s face it, being a diplomat can be a pain in the posterior unless you have the right guidance. And we take it upon ourselves to make every delegate right at home, regardless of their experience. So, what are we waiting for? Let us dive right in.</p>
									<p>This guide will act like a mentor to any first timer guiding them through the entire rules of procedure called the ROP. Time in any MUN committee is divided into three sections:</p>
									<ol> 
										<li>When the council is adjourned/break,</li> 
										<li>Formal session,</li> 
										<li>Informal session.</li>
									</ol>

								<h2>THE AGENDA</h2>
								<p>Each committee is called upon to discuss a certain topic which is referred to as the agenda.</p>
								
								<h2>ROLL CALL</h2>
								<p>In simpler terms, the executive board calls each country from the country matrix so that they can present their stance.</p>
                                    
								<p>Either of the two stances can be opted by each delegate:</p>
				
								<ol>
									<li>Present.<ul>
									<li>Delegates who have opted for this stance can abstain in substantive voting.</li>
									<li>They can always change their voting stance to the second.</li></ul></li>
								
								<li>Present and voting.
									<ul><li>Delegates who have opted for this stance cannot abstain in substantive voting.</li>
									<li>They cannot change their voting stance back.</li></ul></li>
								</ol>
								<h2>MOTIONS</h2>
								<p>As the name is indicative, motions are used to have the entire committee as one do something, for example move from formal session to informal session, or to adjourn or to vote upon the end document.</p>
								<h2>FORMAL SESSION</h2>
								<h4>THE GENERAL SPEAKERS LIST</h4>
								<p>The General Speakers List (GSL) is essentially the list of all delegates who wish to make a speech on the agenda in general. The time given to an individual Delegate is usually 90 seconds to make their speech and this duration can be extended by raising a motion as soon as roll call is done. Then the EB recognizes speakers for the GSL with a show of respective placards. The GSL runs throughout the duration of the three days with willing speakers adding their names to the list. If you wish to add your name to the GSL at a later point, you can do so by sending a chit asking for your country/character to be added to the existing list.</p>

							<h2>INFORMAL SESSION</h2>
							<p>Moving on from formal session, informal session is divided into two parts, the Unmoderated Caucus and the Moderated Caucus. Unmoderated caucuses are more disruptive in nature. Whereas, the moderated caucuses are a lot like the formal form of debate with sub topics of the agenda.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>MODERATED CAUCUS</h3>
									<p>The moderated caucus is basically where you discuss the sub-topics of the agenda in the committee. For example, if the agenda is 'Pollution', then the sub topics could be 'Air Pollution' or 'Water Pollution'.</p>
									<p>As mentioned in the earlier section, motion for a moderated caucus can be raised by following a verbatim/format, which is, “The delegate of [country name] would like to raise a motion to suspend formal session and move into a moderated caucus on the topic [topic] for a total time period [total time] with individual speakers time being [individual speakers time] each”. For moderated caucuses, the total time has to be divisible by the individual speaker’s time. </p>
									<p>For example, “The delegate of Spain would like to raise a motion to suspend formal session and move into a moderated caucus on the topic “Water pollution” for a time period of 20 minutes, with individual speaker's time of 60 seconds”. This motion, if passed, establishes a moderated caucus that accommodates 20 speakers for a discussion on water pollution.</p>
									<p>After various motions are raised by the delegates, the Executive Board sets them for a vote. This is an example of procedural voting, in which a 50% plus one of the members will have to agree (If the committee has 8 members, then 5 members have to agree on it or if the committee has 15 members, then 9 members have to agree on it.) Then the delegate who raised the moderated caucus can choose either to be the first or reserve their right to speak.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>UNMODERATED CAUCUS</h3>
									<p>This is when the delegates are allowed to leave their seats and approach anyone in the committee. This time is usually reserved for lobbying (A word which originated from the practice of Delegates to meet in the UN lobby to discuss various substantive issues, it means trying to talk someone into supporting your view), to reach a compromise or a consensus on various issues, and to plan the future course of action in the committee amongst themselves. The unmoderated caucus can be raised when the EB invites motions, it is raised using the verbatim “The Delegate of {Country Name} would like to suspend formal session and move into an Unmoderated Caucus for a time period {Time Period}”, for example “The Delegate of India would like to raise a motion to suspend formal session and move into an Unmoderated Caucus for a time period of 15 minutes." As the Unmoderated Caucus is the most disruptive, whenever the motion is raised by a delegate, it is almost always the one to be first voted upon.</p>
									<p>During this while, the Delegates can get up from their seats, walk around the room, leave the council room, go and talk to anyone whether it be the Executive Board, any other delegate or any member of the Organizing Committee. This is somewhat similar to a break however it is strongly advised that this time should be used to plan the proceedings of the committee or to win over some other delegate to support your cause. As almost every Executive Board marks on the lobbying skills of a Delegate.

							<h2>WHAT POINTS?</h2>
							<br>
								<div class="row row-cols-2">
								  <div class="col">
									  <h3>POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE</h3>
									  <p>This point is raised when the delegate is in physical discomfort like when the speech of a fellow delegate is inaudible, if you are feeling cold, hot, sweaty or itchy or if you require any form of assistance from the organizing committee.</p>
									</div>
								  <div class="col">
									<h3>POINT OF PARLIAMENTARY ENQUIRY</h3>
									<p>If you are confused about the rules of procedure we have explained here, this point is raised. For example, if the delegate wishes to know about their position in the general speakers list, this point can be raised.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="col">
									<h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3>
									<p>If the EB has made procedural or substantive errors, then this point can be raised. This point can also be raised to point out factual inaccuracies in other delegate’s speech.</p>
									<p>If the delegate of USA calls Lucknow as the capital of India, it is expected from the other delegates to raise a point of order by quoting the statement made by the delegate of USA and giving the correction. If the error is contested, the burden of proof lies with the one who has raised the point. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									<h3>POINT OF INFORMATION</h3>
									<p>Point of information are substantive questions.</p>
									<p>During formal session, if you yield your remaining time to points of information, other delegates will be allowed to ask you various questions on the speech you just made or the stance taken by your country.</p>
									<p>Points of information can also be sent through chits, at any time.</p>

							<h2>VOTING</h2>
							<h3>THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF VOTING, PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE.</h3>
							<br>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm">
								  <h3>PROCEDURAL VOTING</h3>
								  <p>Procedural Voting is done for changing the time limit for the GSL, passing of any motion, or for the temporary suspension of committees for the breaks. First the Executive Board asks for those who are in support of the motion, then those who oppose it. If there are any members who are in oppose the motion, the executive board asks for the those who are ‘For’ the motion, and those who are ‘Against’ it. The vote passes if 50% + 1 number of delegates are for the motion. In procedural voting no one can abstain, and it is absolutely compulsory for all the members of the room to vote.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-sm">
								  <h3>SUBSTANTIVE VOTING</h3>
								  <p>After the three days of the committee are towards an end, after every country/group of countries have submitted their documentation. It is time for those documents to be put to vote. During the substantive voting only the member nations can vote, and often the observer nations are requested to leave the room. Usually the votes can be given in the following ways:</p>
								  <p>Yes: You are in favor of the document, and it is completely aligned to your foreign policy.</p>
								  <p>No: Your country does not wish for the document to be passed.</p>
								  <p>Yes with rights: You are in favor of the document, however you require time to explain to the committee why you are in favor of the document. This is usually done when the document endorses policies which are not aligned with the usual stance taken by the delegate in the committee or the foreign policy of the country. On discretion of the executive board, the delegate is given a certain time to make the his reasons clear.</p>
								  <p>No with rights: The delegate is not in favor of the document, however requires time to explain to the committee, why he is taking this particular stance. (Reread Yes with rights)</p>
								  <p>Abstain: The delegate is neither in favor of the document, nor against it. They wish to remain neutral in regard to the document. </p>

							<h2>WHAT YIELDS?</h2>
							<br>
								<div class="row row-cols-2">
								  <div class="col">
									  <h3>YIELD TO THE EXECUTIVE BOARD</h3>
									  <p>This is the simplest of all the yields. The rest of the time is given to the Executive Board to do whatever pleases them. More often than not, they allow the delegate to sit down and invite the next speaker to speak. However they can also put questions to the Delegate at their discretion.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="col">
									<h3>YIELD TO POINTS OF INFORMATION</h3>
									<p>The Delegate also has the option to yield to points of information. This allows other delegates to raise questions on the speech or the stance taken by the Delegate who is yielding their time.</p>
								  </div>
								  <div class="col">
									<h3>YIELD TO COMMENT</h3>
									<p>This yield allows other delegates to comment upon the substantive points raised by the delegate in their speech.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									<h3>YIELD TO ANOTHER DELEGATE</h3>
									<p>The delegate can yield their time to another delegate, however it can be done only if there is the consent of both the delegates. On the other hand, if you wish to make a speech which will require more than the allotted time, you can request the delegate whose name comes above you in the GSL to yield some time to you.

								<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
								<h3>POSITION PAPER</h3>
								<p>Some committees in a conference require you to send a position paper beforehand. A position paper explains your country’s situation pertaining to the agenda of the committee. It is a document that contains your country’s policies and position in regards to the matter. A position paper is usually of one or two pages. It should be simple and should contains what your country has been doing and what it believes should be done to address the agenda. It should also contain how the agenda affects your country and your country’s history with the agenda.</p>								
								
								<h3>AD HOC COMMITTEES</h3>
								<p>During the proceedings of Security Council, in special cases, a standing, ad hoc committee is established via a draft a resolution to address to a particular issue. The committee is dissolved as soon as the issue is under control. The details of the committee, including the budget, the background, the parties involved, the obligations, mandate, hierarchy are mentioned in a document. An example can be found out at <a href="http://www.vitcmun.in/IFMR/" style="text-decoration: underline">www.vitcmun.in/IFMR/</a>
								</p>
								
								<h3>ACTION ORDER</h3>
								<p>In crisis committees, such as the Arab League, the delegates, usually, have executive authority over the military forces pertaining to certain restrictions. Essentially, they can move their troops, plan strategic, covert spy missions, tactical movements, propaganda missions etc. These are done through action orders, the format of which, will be provided in the background guide or by the executive board.</p>

										<h2>DOCUMENTATION</h2>
										<h3>Draft Resolution</h3>
										<p>Any member nation, observer or combination of the same can submit a Draft Resolution as sponsors. It is a document that contains the solutions proposed by the sponsors. It is usually preceded with a written paper and then compiled into a draft resolution. The draft resolution had a specific format. If a majority is obtained, the draft resolution becomes a resolution that is passed in the committee. For example refer to <a href="http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/2177">United Nations Security Council Resolution 2177.</a></p>
